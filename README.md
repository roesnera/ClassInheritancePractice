# ClassInheritancePractice

Today you work on objects, classes, and inheritance.  To do this, you will work independently on this project.  It should take you about 35 minutes.

For this project you will make three classes: one parent class and two child classes.

Your parent class should have:
    Three properties
    One method

Your child classes should have:
    One additional property each

One of your child classes should include an additional method

You can make your classes anything you want (e.g. Person, Vehicle, Media, Ship, School, etc.) there are no restrictions on what your classes are or what their methods do.  Get creative!

I have included a sample project to demonstrate a basic version of these specifications for clarity, as well as an index file that links to the app.js file to allow you to check your tests in the browser.
